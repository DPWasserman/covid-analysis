# COVID Analysis
## Analysis of COVID in the United States

During the past year, the world has been beset by a pandemic going by many names: Coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-COV-2, et al. It is said that to defeat one's opponent, one must know the enemy. Understanding trend analysis and correlation is a good approach.

This project attempts to visualize the trends of the disease on two levels: Cases and Deaths. This is done on a state by state basis.

Data about the disease was obtained from [healthdata.gov](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/united-states-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-state-over-time) while population data for 2020 came from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population).
