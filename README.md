## Analysis of COVID in the United States

During the past year, the world has been beset by a pandemic going by many names: Coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-COV-2, et al. It is said that to defeat one's opponent, one must know the enemy. Understanding trend analysis and correlation is a good approach.

This project attempts to visualize the trends of the disease on two levels: Cases and Deaths. This is done on a state by state basis.

Data about the disease was obtained from healthdata.gov while population data for 2020 came from Wikipedia.
